---

## 📦 Dependencies
Tasky requires:
- **dotnet-sdk** (to build/run C#)
- **mpv** (to play `.mp3`/`.wav` reminder sounds)
- **ffmpeg** (optional, adds more sound format support)
- **Newtonsoft.Json** (installed automatically by the script)

---

## 🚀 Installation
Clone the repository and run the install script:


    git clone https://github.com/execRooted/Tasky.git

```
cd Tasky
```
```
chmod +x installer.sh
```
```
./installer.sh
```


***The installer:***

- Focuses on system-wide installation (root required)

- Uses cross-system tools, depending on what distro it detected

 - Creates a dotnet DLL launcher rather than single-file binary

 - Adds optional desktop entry (GUI integration)

 - Installs mpv for sound notifications

<h3>Once installed, simply run:</h3>

```

```
No matter where you are in your terminal, Tasky will start.
Tasks are saved in the same directory as the executable unless configured otherwise.

<h2>❌ Uninstallation</h2>

**To completely remove Tasky, run these commands in the project directory:**

```
chmod +x uninstaller.sh
```
```
./uninstaller.sh
```

The uninstaller will:

   - Remove the tasky binary from ~/.local/bin

   - Delete the local .NET project folder

   - Optionally remove ~/.local/bin from your PATH if empty

   - Delete the /var/lib/tasky directory created during instalation

   <h3>💡 Notes</h3>

   -  Task data is stored in tasks.json in the /var/lib/tasky directory by default — you can change this to whatever you prefer. It was added there for global access.
